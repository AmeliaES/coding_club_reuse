# Materials for coding club (Friday 6th June, 11am-12pm)

Our next coding club will be on best practices for creating reusable code. This topic was the most upvoted in the Coding Club Topics doc.

> Your software project could range from a small script you use for data processing to a notebook used for data analysis, or a software library implementing your algorithms. Regardless of how big or small your software project is, it is important to make your code reusable.

We will go over some of the materials covered  in the [Turing Way Book](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/code-reuse/code-reuse-details).

Then we will put into practice what we have learnt and use their checklist to go through our own code to see how reusable it really is.
